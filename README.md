## üõ†Ô∏è Future Enhancements

> **Next:**  
> Integrate advanced AI-assisted (aai) tools for better intrusion detection and deeper port/protocol analysis.

Ideas:

- Use AI/ML models for anomaly detection and traffic classification
- Smart port intelligence and risk ranking
- Integration with open source threat intelligence feeds
